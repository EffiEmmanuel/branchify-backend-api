Certainly! Here's a template for a well-formatted README.md file for your Branchify web app using N-Tier architecture:

```markdown
# Branchify

Branchify is a linktree-like web application built using Node.js for the backend and REST API. It allows users to create a personalized page containing links to their social media profiles, websites, projects, or any other content they want to share with others.

## Architecture

Branchify follows an N-Tier architecture, which enhances security and separates concerns into different layers. The architecture consists of the following layers:

1. **API Layer**: This layer handles incoming HTTP requests and acts as the entry point for the application. It receives requests from clients, performs any necessary validation, and delegates the processing to the business logic layer.

2. **Business Logic Layer**: The business logic layer contains the core functionality of the application. It handles the processing and manipulation of data, enforces business rules, and coordinates communication between the API layer and the data access layer.

3. **Data Access Layer**: The data access layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It encapsulates the logic for retrieving and persisting data, providing a clean interface for the business logic layer to interact with the underlying data storage.

4. **Database**: The database stores the application's data. It can be any type of database that suits your application's requirements, such as a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB).
